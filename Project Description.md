### **Introduction**

In the dynamic landscape of the hospitality industry, the efficiency of managing hotel bookings plays a vital role in the achievement of success within an establishment or organization. The increasing frequency of online bookings and online platforms has become the most common form of hotel reservations. However, this rise in online activity comes with its own set of challenges, with cancellations being a primary threat to hotel owners. This project focuses on optimizing the process of hotel bookings and the prevention of cancellations using machine learning models. By leveraging predictive analytics, the project aims to provide valuable insights to hotel management and the hospitality industry as a whole, improving operational efficiency, resource allocation, and overall customer satisfaction. The project is divided into **five phases**, each addressing a key step in the project deployment. Below is a detailed description of each phase.

### Project Phases

---

#### **Phase 1: Problem Identification and Specification**

- **Objective:** Understand the challenges of hotel booking cancellations and prepare the necessary dataset for predictive modeling.

- **Key Tasks:**
  1. **Introduction to the Problem:**
     - Explored the impact of cancellations on hotel management, including revenue loss, resource misallocation, and customer satisfaction.
     - Highlighted the potential of machine learning to mitigate cancellations and optimize hotel booking systems.
  
  2. **Literature Review:**
     - Reviewed prior research on machine learning applications in the hospitality industry, including:
       - Logistic regression models for cancellation prediction.
       - The use of time-series analysis and machine learning to understand evolving cancellation trends.
       - Studies emphasizing the influence of price dynamics and guest demographics on cancellations.
  
  3. **Data Collection and Overview:**
     - Chose a detailed dataset containing 31 variables and 119,000 observations from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
     - Variables include booking details (e.g., lead time, arrival date), guest demographics, and reservation statuses.
     - Justified the choice of the first dataset over a smaller alternative for deeper analysis and enhanced model accuracy.

- **Outcome:** A well-understood problem scope and a comprehensive dataset ready for analysis in subsequent project phases.

#### **Phase 2: Data Preparation, Cleaning, and Feature Engineering**

- **Objective:** Refine and enhance the dataset for optimal machine learning model performance.

- **Key Tasks:**
  1. **Handling Missing Values:**
     - Dropped observations with missing values in the `children` column.
     - Filled missing values in the `country` column with the mode ("Portugal").
     - Dropped features `agent` and `company` due to a high proportion of missing values.
  
  2. **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
     - One-hot encoded features like `hotel`, `meal`, `market segment`, and `distribution channel`.
     - Transformed `country` into two categories: `Portugal` and `International`.
     - Simplified `meal` by merging "Undefined" and "SC" categories.
  
  3. **Feature Engineering:**
     - Created a `kids` feature by combining `children` and `babies`.
     - Combined `stays in weekend nights` and `stays in week nights` into a single feature, `total_stays`.
     - Normalized `lead_time` and dropped the original column.
     - Combined `arrival year`, `month`, and `day` into a single `arrival_date` feature.
  
  4. **Outlier Treatment:**
     - Corrected the outlier in the `ADR` column by setting the value of 5400 to 540.

  5. **New Target Variable:**
     - Consolidated `reservation_status` categories. Combined "Canceled" and "No-show" into "0" (reservation not completed), and "Check-out" was encoded as "1" (reservation completed).

- **Outcome:** A clean dataset with 43 features and 118,983 observations, ready for training machine learning models.

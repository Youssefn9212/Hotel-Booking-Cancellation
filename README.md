# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
This project aims to build the full machine-learning pipeline to forecast the probability of a potential customer canceling their hotel booking based on reservation criteria, including variables like their arrival date, number of guests, deposit type, etc. The project is split into 5 phases, each tackling a different step in the project deployment, the description of these phases can be found below.

Phase 1: Problem Identification and Specification
This phase of the project focuses on exploring and preparing the necessary data for the prediction of hotel booking cancellations as well as providing a brief literature review on the topic. The data is gathered from two hotel booking datasets, with a preference for the more detailed first dataset due to its larger scale and more comprehensive information. The functionality of this phase includes cleaning, organizing, and structuring the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis and machine learning modeling. It also involves identifying and defining the variables relevant to predicting cancellations, such as booking dates, guest demographics, room type, market segment, and previous booking behaviors. The goal is to prepare a high-quality dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in subsequent phases of the project.

Phase 2: Data preparation, cleaning, and feature generation

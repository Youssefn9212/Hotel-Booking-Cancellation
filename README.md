# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project aims to build a complete machine learning pipeline to forecast the probability of a potential customer canceling their hotel booking. Predictions are based on reservation criteria, including variables like arrival date, number of guests, deposit type, and more. The project is divided into **five phases**, each addressing a key step in the project deployment. Below is a detailed description of each phase.

### Project Phases

#### **Phase 1: Problem Identification and Specification**  
- **Objective:** Explore and prepare the data necessary for predicting hotel booking cancellations.  
- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Perform a literature review on similar predictive models in the hospitality industry.  
  - Clean, organize, and structure the data for analysis and machine learning modeling.  
  - Identify and define relevant variables, such as:  
    - Booking dates  
    - Guest demographics  
    - Room types  
    - Market segment  
    - Previous booking behaviors  
- **Outcome:** A high-quality, well-structured dataset ready for machine learning model training.

#### **Phase 2: Data Preparation, Cleaning, and Feature Engineering**  
- **Objective:** Refine and enhance the dataset for optimal model performance.  
- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Handle missing and inconsistent values in the dataset.  
  - Encode categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).  
  - Generate new features based on existing data.
